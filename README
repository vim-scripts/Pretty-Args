This plugin provides an :Arg command which can nicely print the output of :args.  Read more in the included doc file.

The main reason for this plugin is to remove a common directory when you work on a project which files are deep under some common project directory and you use autodir vim option.  In this case :args command shows very long filenames and the arg list becomes to readable.  You can use:
Args :p:s?^/path/to/project/directory/??
or even
Args :p:s?^/path/to/project/directory/??:S
to shorten the path.  If you work on a Django project and you use args and friends this command will be very useful.

If you rate this plugin, especially down rate and you have a reason for that, please send me an email mszamot [AT] gmail [DOT] com . Otherwise, why to rate at all ...?
